This repository provides a standardized archive of the US Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency (FSA) [Farm Payment Files](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/tools/informational/freedom-information-act-foia/electronic-reading-room/frequently-requested/payment-files). These files contain detailed records of payments made to agricultural program participants, originally released as Microsoft Excel files.

The included R script automates the discovery, download, and conversion of these files into a partitioned, analysis-ready format.

---

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `fsa-payment-files.R`: Main R script to download, extract, clean, and write the payment files to a partitioned Parquet format.
- `README.Rmd`: This file. Contains background information, usage instructions, and archive structure.
- `data-raw/`: Folder used for downloading and unpacking Excel and CSV files.
- `fsa-payment-files/`: Final output directory containing the processed data as a Parquet dataset, partitioned by state and year.

---

## 🔁 Processing Workflow

The `fsa-payment-files.R` script performs the following steps:

1. **Discovery**: Scrapes the FSA payment files website to find downloadable Excel files (2004–2024).
2. **Download**: Saves original files to `data-raw/`.
3. **Extraction**: Parses each Excel file, handling annual variation in schema and formatting.
4. **Standardization**: Renames fields, standardizes formats (e.g., FIPS codes, program names), and removes duplicates.
5. **Archiving**: Writes the full dataset to the `fsa-payment-files/` directory as partitioned Parquet files (`State FSA Name=` and `Accounting Program Year=` directories).
6. **Upload** *(optional)*: Uses the AWS `paws` package to upload the full Parquet archive to a public S3 bucket for remote access.

---

## ☁️ Public Access via S3

The full archive is hosted in a public Amazon S3 bucket:

```
s3://sustainable-fsa/fsa-payments/
```

You can access the data directly using:

### AWS CLI
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://sustainable-fsa/fsa-payment-files/ --no-sign-request
```

### In R with `arrow` and `s3://` support
```{r}
library(arrow)
dataset <- 
  open_dataset("s3://sustainable-fsa/fsa-payment-files/", 
               filesystem = s3_bucket("sustainable-fsa", anonymous = TRUE))
```

---

## 🧭 Notes

- File structure varies by year, and the script includes heuristics to detect column shifts and missing headers.
- Partitioning by state and year facilitates fast querying and cloud-native workflows.
- The processing script can be rerun to include new years as they are released.

---

## 📅 Update Schedule

This dataset is refreshed annually after the USDA FSA releases new payment files, typically in the spring. Additional years or corrections may be processed as available.

## 📍 Quick Start: Visualize data in the FSA Farm Payment Files in R

This snippet shows how to load data from the Farm Payment Files archive and create a simple map using `sf` and `ggplot2`.

```{r example, message=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', dpi=300, fig.path = './'}
# Load required libraries
library(arrow)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2) # For plotting
library(tigris)  # For state boundaries
library(rmapshaper) # For innerlines function

# Example accessing payment files on S3
# A map of 2024 LFP Payments by county

lfp_payments <-
  # arrow::s3_bucket("sustainable-fsa/fsa-payment-files",
  #                  anonymous = TRUE) %>%
  "fsa-payment-files" |>
  arrow::open_dataset() |>
  dplyr::filter(`Accounting Program Description` %in% 
                  c(
                    "LIVESTOCK FORAGE PROGRAM",
                    "LIVESTOCK FORAGE DISASTER PROGRAM"
                  )) |>
  dplyr::group_by(`FSA Code`) |>
  dplyr::summarise(
    `Disbursement Amount` = sum(`Disbursement Amount`, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  dplyr::collect()

## The Normal Grazing Period data files use FSA county definitions
## Download from the FSA_Counties_dd17 archive
counties <- 
  sf::read_sf("https://sustainable-fsa.github.io/fsa-counties-dd17/fsa-counties-dd17.topojson",
              layer = "counties") |>
  sf::st_set_crs("EPSG:4326") |>
  sf::st_transform("EPSG:5070")

## 🧭 About FSA County Codes

The USDA FSA uses custom county definitions that differ from standard ANSI/FIPS codes used by the U.S. Census. To align the Farm Payment Files with geographic boundaries, use the FSA-specific geospatial dataset archived in the companion repository:

🔗 [**sustainable-fsa/fsa-counties-dd17**](https://sustainable-fsa.github.io/fsa-counties-dd17/)

FSA county codes are documented in [FSA Handbook 1-CM, Exhibit 101](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/1-cm_r03_a80.pdf).
